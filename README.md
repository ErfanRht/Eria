  <h1 align="center">Eria: A Fully Custom-Built IDE</h1>
</p>

<p align="left">
Eria is not just another IDE—it is a testament to old-school software craftsmanship. Built entirely from scratch using C++ and SDL, Eria does not rely on modern frameworks or pre-made UI toolkits. Instead, every aspect, from rendering the interface to managing the core functionalities, has been meticulously crafted using low-level techniques.

By following a traditional, hands-on development approach, Eria revives the essence of classic software engineering, proving that even in today's automated world, raw programming skills can still build something powerful and efficient.
